# garrysmod-meta
Unoffical meta repository about the development and management of Garry's Mod. Independent from Facepunch's moderation and development.

Issues dicussed here are not subject to Facepunch's moderation. So more uncomfortable and/or hidden stuff about certain issues can be talked about here without direct risks.

This especially involves topics such as:
- Issues with bad community communication or management.
- Information collection and coordination on hot/popular, but ignored issues or requests.
- Organizing efforts to push said ignored issues in a constructive manner.
- Discussing long running or badly managed requests or pull requests.
- Information that Facepunch does not want in their repositories.
- Issues that are caused or affected by conflict of interest in the Facepunch staff.
- Organizing efforts to neutralize the developer side tunnel vision around certain issues.
- Organizing efforts to neutralize potential issues with: Censorship, gaslighting or otherwise toxic behaviour.
- Issues that are caused or affected by gatekeeping if reasonable by nature.
- Place to vent on issues you would get striken down for otherwise.

This is not a place for:
- Toxic behaviour towards anyone, especially not towards Facepunch staff. This includes having a history of such.
- Security issues and exploits that haven't been publicly disclosed as such to the official repository yet.
- Anything around cheat or anti-cheats.
- Anything malicious code or addons.
- Any other harmful content in any way.
